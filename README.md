# MRTracer

MRTracer is a real-time path tracer that renders scenes remotely on a selected environment and streams the results to a client application running in the browser.

MRTracer utilizes a GPU-based path tracing implementation using CUDA, requiring the remote rendering environment to be equipped with NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support.

Rendering results are displayed in the client application within the browser. MRTracer supports multi-GPU rendering and allows users to choose from various load-balancing algorithms to distribute the workload efficiently among devices.
